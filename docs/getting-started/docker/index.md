# Docker or Podman

Before going further, here are quick definitions of what a container is and what a `composer` is, this is important and must be understood before starting.

!!! note "Note"

    Both of the definitions below are valid for either Docker or Podman. :thumbsup:

## Container definition

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.

## Composer definition

> A composer is a tool for defining and running multi-container container applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
